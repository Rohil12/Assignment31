By converting Z-scores to percentiles or using a standard normal distribution table, you can determine the likelihood of a value being above or below a certain threshold1.\\nHypothesis Testing: Z-scores are used in hypothesis testing to determine the significance of results. By comparing the Z-score of a sample statistic to critical values, you can decide whether to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis2.\\nIdentifying Outliers: Z-scores help identify outliers, which are data points significantly different from the rest of the dataset. Typically, data points with Z-scores greater than 3 or less than -3 are considered potential outliers2.\\nComparing Datasets: Z-scores allow you to compare data points from different datasets by standardizing the values.
